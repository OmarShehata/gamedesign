Two game developers making the same idea could make games of completely different quality. This is where game design plays a crucial role.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #2: Prototyping is crucial!**\r\n\r\nYou can never know if a game idea is fun or not or if it works without first prototyping it. Doing so gives you a sense of direction for the game and could save you a lot of time working on a game that just isn’t fun or engaging.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #3: Follow the feedback loop**\r\n\r\nIt’s very important to get feedback on your game, even in its early stages. Playtest, see what the players think and how the game can be improved, playtest again and repeat.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #4: The difference between good and great is polish**\r\n\r\nPolishing your game can make a huge difference. Here are two very useful links:\r\n\r\nJuice it or lose it talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg\r\n\r\nVlambeer’s Polish Demo: http://indiestatik.com/2013/11/21/game-teaches-30-tricks-make-action-game-feel-better/\r\n\r\n**Lesson #5: If the player doesn’t know how to play, it’s your fault**\r\n\r\nThe developer is responsible for making the game easy to learn. Few players bother to read tutorials, integrate your tutorial into the game. Don’t give them all the information at once; only explain to them what they need when they need it.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #6: Frustation != Difficulty**\r\n\r\nDifficult games can be great. Frustrating games are not. A game can be frustrating when a player loses because of something he could not control, like bad controls, or the game tricking the player, making it feel unfair.\r\nDark Souls and Super Meat Boy do difficulty really well without being frustrating.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #7: Your first game will suck**\r\n\r\nStart small, you will learn a lot, and as we saw, small prototypes can go very far.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #8: Games are not movies**\r\n\r\nThe great thing about games is interactivity. They let players live the story. You don’t need to take control away from the player to show them a cutscene, you can make them live the story. The game Journey does this really well\r\n\r\n**Lesson #9: Games can make a difference**\r\n\r\nGames influence us in all sorts of ways. \r\n\r\n### Contact Info\r\nOmar Shehata\r\n\r\nomar@thoseawesomeguys.com\r\n\r\nwww.concernedjoe.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bonus: List Of Great Games To Checkout\r\n\r\n(Curated by Xelu)\r\n\r\n## Action\r\n\r\n**Last Of Us** - Great graphics and immersion, characters feel real\r\n\r\n**Mark of the Ninja** - Stealth done properly\r\n\r\n**Mirror's Edge** - A new genre of first person parkour\r\n\r\n**Shadow of the Colussus** - Years ahead of its time\r\n\r\n**Starbound** - Minecraft 2D in space with an infinite universe\r\n\r\n**Bastion** - Excellence in narrative and art style\r\n\r\n## Shooter\r\n\r\n**Quake 3** - Fast paced arena shooter\r\n\r\n**Half Life 2** - Great mood, great design, game of the decade\r\n\r\n**Bioshock 1** - Mindblowing story with great exploration shooter gameplay\r\n\r\n**Deus Ex** - Superb marketing campaign, awesome universe, great commentary on human modification\r\n\r\n**Spec Ops** - Proves that games are not all about fun, war hallucations\r\n\r\n**Counter Strike** - The perfect balance in a team based shooter\r\n\r\n**Left 4 Dead** - A proper zombie apocalypse, engaging and fun with friends\r\n\r\n## Adventure & Exploration\r\n\r\n**Amnesia** - Mind tricks, relying on your imagination to scare you instead of jump scares\r\n\r\n**To The Moon** - Beautiful story, unlike anything else\r\n\r\n**Monkey Island** - Possibly the most hilarious adventure game in existance\r\n\r\n**The Walking Dead** - Amazing decision making gameplay and constant pressure\r\n\r\n**Fez** - Unique perspective bending puzzles and soothing environment & soundtrack\r\n\r\n**Gone Home** - A breath of fresh air between the shooter filled industry\r\n\r\n**Journey** - Beautiful relaxing experience and unique social interactions\r\n\r\n## Experimental \r\n\r\n**Braid** - The master game of time manipulation, platformer based time puzzles, oil painted art\r\n\r\n**Papers Please** - Turning the mundane into an engaging activity, stepping on your moral code\r\n\r\n**One Chance** - Flash game where you have one shot at curing a deadly disease\r\n\r\n**Little Inferno** - Amazing commentary on addiction\r\n\r\n**Portal** - Mindblowing gameplay mechanics, creative puzzles\r\n\r\n**The Stanley Parable** - So meta it hurts, though provoking humor\r\n\r\n**Antichamber** - Mind boggling puzzles, walking in an Escher painting\r\n\r\n**Chroma** - A game where you walk on the shadows you create\r\n\r\n## Strategy \r\n\r\n**Starcraft** - The best real time rock paper scissors game\r\n\r\n**Xcom & Frozen Synapse** - Turn based top down tactical team fights\r\n\r\n**FTL** - Interstellar strategic ship battles, customize your ship and manage your crew during fights\r\n\r\n**Civ V** - Growing a civilization from the stone age to space ships\r\n\r\n**Dota 2** - Multiplayer team based arena fight with a huge emphasis on strategy and cooperation\r\n\r\n**Day Z** - Zombie apocalypse where the zombies are the least of your problems\r\n\r\n**Hotline Miami** - Epileptic adrenaline rush top down incredibly fast paced combat, amazing music","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
