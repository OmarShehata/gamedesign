Two game developers making the same idea could make games of completely different quality. This is where game design plays a crucial role.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #2: Prototyping is crucial!**\r\n\r\nYou can never know if a game idea is fun or not or if it works without first prototyping it. Doing so gives you a sense of direction for the game and could save you a lot of time working on a game that just isn’t fun or engaging.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #3: Follow the feedback loop**\r\n\r\nIt’s very important to get feedback on your game, even in its early stages. Playtest, see what the players think and how the game can be improved, playtest again and repeat.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #4: The difference between good and great is polish**\r\n\r\nPolishing your game can make a huge difference. Here are two very useful links:\r\nJuice it or lose it talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg\r\nVlambeer’s Polish Demo: http://indiestatik.com/2013/11/21/game-teaches-30-tricks-make-action-game-feel-better/\r\n\r\n**Lesson #5: If the player doesn’t know how to play, it’s your fault**\r\n\r\nThe developer is responsible for making the game easy to learn. Few players bother to read tutorials, integrate your tutorial into the game. Don’t give them all the information at once; only explain to them what they need when they need it.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #6: Frustation != Difficulty**\r\n\r\nDifficult games can be great. Frustrating games are not. A game can be frustrating when a player loses because of something he could not control, like bad controls, or the game tricking the player, making it feel unfair.\r\nDark Souls and Super Meat Boy do difficulty really well without being frustrating.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #7: Your first game will suck**\r\n\r\nStart small, you will learn a lot, and as we saw, small prototypes can go very far.\r\n\r\n**Lesson #8: Games are not movies**\r\n\r\nThe great thing about games is interactivity. They let players live the story. You don’t need to take control away from the player to show them a cutscene, you can make them live the story. The game Journey does this really well\r\n\r\n**Lesson #9: Games can make a difference**\r\n\r\nGames influence us in all sorts of ways. \r\n\r\n### Contact Info\r\nOmar Shehata\r\nomar@thoseawesomeguys.com\r\nwww.concernedjoe.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
